# Rainfall Prediction for Logistics Optimization


### Project Overview
This project explores how weather patterns affect delivery timelines and logistics performance. By analyzing weather and delivery data together, the goal was to uncover delays, optimize route planning, and minimize operational risk due to external environmental factors.

### Business Problem
Logistics companies often face unpredictable delivery delays due to adverse weather conditions. However, these impacts are rarely quantified or predicted, leading to poor customer satisfaction and operational inefficiencies.

### Goal: 
Identify how weather affects delivery performance and help businesses make data-driven decisions to mitigate delays, improve routing, and enhance service levels.

### What I Did
- Performed data cleaning, merging weather and logistics datasets for integrated analysis
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to detect correlations between weather events (e.g., rain, wind) and delayed deliveries
- Visualized key metrics like average delivery time by weather condition, location-wise delay patterns, and seasonal trends
- Flagged high-risk routes/locations frequently affected by weather
- Suggested mitigation strategies (e.g., alternate routes, delay buffers, proactive rescheduling)


 Business Impact
- Helped stakeholders understand where and how weather affects logistics delays
- Provided insight to improve route planning and reduce customer complaints
- Set the foundation for predictive models and smarter logistics scheduling

  
Skills Used - Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Skicit-learn), Machine Learning (Regression)
